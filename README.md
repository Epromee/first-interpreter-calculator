# first_interpreter_calculator
My first attempt to parse the shit and do some cheety hacky computations with it.

So, I want to write a compiler.

After first try of reading and misunderstanding the Dragon Book,
I have a little bit of parsing knowledge.

Here we go, this is my first arithmetical expressions parser,
not as strict as the Dragon Book told us, but I think not bad.

The next compiler-oriented project would be much better, I think.

For this:
You enter something like "(2 + 3) * (5 - 4) / (2 + - + (3))"
and get your result.

If you are wrong, that guy will punish you with long scary red error reports.
